# Benchmark Code

Code for benchmarking accuracy and performance of various functions.

High-precision data (in ../data/) was created using Mathematica's
arbitrary precision arithmetic.

Diagnostic plots go into plots/

# Simple cases

These cases are fairly straight forward implementations, and so these
"benchmarks" are really just testing that the code works, and getting
some insight into the size of errors in the functions being used in
the computations.

# Polylogarithm tests



# Other

Not all functions and values are tested yet. Notably: 

Dbeta
